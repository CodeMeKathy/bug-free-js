//

//* String

//* Number

// -Due to the nature of integers and floating in most languages, including JS, it is best not to store money in cents and convert it when rendering it to the pages.

//* Object

//* Null and Undefined
// - Two ways to describe nothing in JS.
//  - Undefined is a variable that is unassigned and has yet to have a value set to it.
// Null is a value of nothing.

//* Booleans and Equality

// A flag variable is one that is set to true or false
//  Tipple equal is what we should generally be using give a few edge cases.  This is because it checks for both value and type.
//  Ex.

console.log('10' == 10)
console.log('10' === 10)
